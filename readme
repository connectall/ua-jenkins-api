The ConnectALL-Jenkins adapter allows Jenkins to be integrated with other endpoints. It provides two basic 
features but this is a template for other use cases. The two use cases are build a workspace, and send the 
results of the build back to the requesting endpoint.

For example, a new 'build-request' ticket could be created in JIRA. The poll.sh script will find the new or 
updated tickets and will kick off the specified build via a rest call to Jenkins. When the build is complete
the post_results.sh script will be called as a final step in the build which will send a build-complete
message back to JIRA.

To implement this bi-directional flow for builds the following components must be setup:

1) A new issue type in JIRA that will request a new build.
2) An application link in ConnectALL that pipes the JIRA build request to the workspace in Jenkins.
3) The build in Jenkins that is run, which also sends a build-complete message back to Jira.
5) An application link in ConnectALL that pipes the build-complete back to a JIRA subtask.
6) The scripts (setup.sh, poll.sh, and post-results.sh) that does the communication between Jenkins and ConnectALL.

The dependencies for this to work include:

1) The jp program that parses the json
2) The wget program used to communicate with jenkins to kick off the build
3) If running on windows the git-bash client to run the scripts.

The required modifications of the .sh scripts include:
1) Set the following properties in the setup.sh script:
	a) ConnectAllUrl - the ConnectAll rest api hostname and port. Typically the port is 8090, eg, http://localhost:8090
	b) JenkinsUrl - the Jenkins rest api hostname and port.
	c) ConnectAllApiKey - the ConnectAll api key generated in the ConnectAll ui. Setting is per user.
	d) JenkinsApiKey - the Jenkins api key generated in the Jenkins api.
2) Change the following values in the poll.sh script:
	a) The appLinkName to the name of your application link in ConnectAll that sends the build request to Jenkins.
	b) The credentials for Jenkins on the wget call.
3) Change the following value in the post-result.sh script:
	a) The appLinkName to the name of your application link in ConnectAll that sends the build response to the other endpoint.

Note the poll.sh script calls Jenkins to start a paramaterized job. The job name is in the workspace field 
mapped in the build request application link. In my example I used the JIRA component field to allow the user
to select the build to run. The paramter to the job is the id of the artifact requesting the job to be run (eg the issuekey in Jira).
This id is then sent back in the build-complete message so the two issues can be linked.

Application Links:

Two application links must be created in ConnectAll. One to map the build-request from the other endpoint to Jenkins. And another appliction link
to map the build-complete message from Jenkins to the other endpoint.

An example build-request mapping:
	Jira				Jenkins
	-----				-------
	Component(s)	->	workspace
	Caused By		->	title
	issuekey		->	id
	
And the build-request mapping:
	Jenkins				Jira (subtask)
	-------				----
	title			->	Summary
	Build URL		->	Custom field
	Linked Story Id	->	SubParent Parent Id
	
Jenkins Job:
	The Jenkins job must also be setup to run your build, and then send a message to ConnectAll when the build is complete, eg:

	echo "The test passed for request %artifact_id% "
	"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh" ./post_results.sh %WORKSPACE% %BUILD_TAG% %ERRORLEVEL% Pass %artifact_id% "
	
Startup instructions:
	1) Start up the poll.sh script. There is a forever.sh script that can run the poll every minute.
	2) Create a build-request in Jira.
	
After the build completes it will create a new subtask in Jira. Its parent is the original build-request.
